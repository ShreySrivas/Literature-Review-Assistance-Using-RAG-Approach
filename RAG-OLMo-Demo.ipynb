    "The RAG based approach below is a demonstration of how to use [OLMo-1B](https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-1B) LLM model by AI2 to generate an abstract completion for a given input text. The input text is a random starting abstract from `astro-ph` category of [ArXiv Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv). The abstract completion is generated by the model using the RAG approach. The RAG approach retrieves relevant documents from [Qdrant Vector Database](https://qdrant.tech/), which provides contextual information to the model for generating the completion.\n",

In this work, we use the \\nLeiden-Argentine-Bonn (LAB) all-sky HI survey to investigate the properties\\nof the Magellanic Stream and the leading arm (LA) of the SMC. We find that the\\nleading arm of the SMC is very young compared to the rest of the stream, with a mean age\\nof 1.74 ± 0.09 Gyr. The leading arm of the SMC is also much more elongated than\\nthe rest of the stream, with a mean elongation of 2.4 ± 0.3 pc. The leading arm of\\nthe SMC is also significantly more extended than the leading arm of the LMC. Our results\\nshow that the leading arm of the SMC is likely the result of tidal stripping of the SMCs\\nby the LMC. The leading arm of the SMC is also the source of the observed halo of\\ngas around the SMC. We find that the leading arm of the SMC is mostly made up of\\nhalo gas, while the rest of the stream is mainly made up of stars. The halo of gas\\naround the SMC is consistent with the idea that the leading arm of the SMC is the result of\\na tidal interaction between the SMC and the LMC.'}\n",

In this work we present new results from our analysis of the\\nGalaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Hα observations of the Magellanic Stream.\\nThe main goal of this work is to investigate the properties of the Magellanic Stream\\nin order to better understand how it formed and evolved. To achieve this goal we\\nhave used the GALEX Hα observations to determine the kinematics of the\\nstream. We find that the stream is highly elongated and that it has a significant\\nrotation rate.
